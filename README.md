# EVORA
Capstone II project for group 14

"website" is the main django file. Open it and there will be a file called "requirements" that list all the programs needed to be installed into the virtual environment when running python.

the zips "PropertyImage part 1" and "PropertyImage part 1" need to be unzipped inside the file Website\media\PropertyImage

the zips "images 1", "images 2" and "images 3" need to be unzipped into the file Website\media\static

To run website, create a virtual environment, install django, install all packages inside "requirements" and then run the django server.
